Hello Community, I am Mazen form germany, and I hope to get some help here with my Java Code, as I am stuck with the Rock, Paper, Scissory Program... 

While getting a random value out of the "Rock, Paper, Scisors" Array  I am facing the  issue that the output is not beeing display correctly. In this Case the console is just showing an "u"

```js
// Computer Hand
function computersPlay (computerSelection) {
    
    return computerSelection[Math.floor(Math.random()*computerSelection.length)];

};
    let arrayZeugs = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"];
    let computerSelection = arrayZeugs;
    console.log(computersPlay("This is your output" + computerSelection));

```
When I am doing it without an description text it works fine

```js
// Computer Hand
function computersPlay (computerSelection) {
    
    return computerSelection[Math.floor(Math.random()*computerSelection.length)];

};
    let arrayZeugs = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"];
    let computerSelection = arrayZeugs;
    console.log(computersPlay("computerSelection));

```

any ideas or hints ? 

Many thanks for your help in advance

regards Mazen
